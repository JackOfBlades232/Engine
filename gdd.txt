=*= Reckless Pillager, a curses roguelike =*=


In this game you play as a pillager, who stole the sword of the Last Emperor
of the accursed capital from his grave, and is trying to escape the dead city.
However, it seems that once you picked up the heirloom, the ghostly ruins came
alive with illusions and monsters. Now, you will have to navigate through
mazes, fight monsters and solve puzzles in order to escape with the prize. 
Fortunately, the sword that you now wield is a grand weapon indeed, and seems
to have some unusual magical abilities, that might aid you in your escape.

== General description ==

The view is top down, and the player proceeds through a series of maze-like
rooms. At first the player does not see the layout of the room, but it gets
revealed to him as he proceeds. However, he does not see points of interest,
loot or enemies unless he has line of sight to them.
