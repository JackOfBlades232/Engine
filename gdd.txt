=== Reckless Pillager, a curses roguelike ===


In this game you play as a pillager, who stole the sword of the Last Emperor
of the accursed capital from his grave, and is trying to escape the dead city.
However, it seems that once you picked up the heirloom, the ghostly ruins came
alive with illusions and monsters. Now, you will have to navigate through
mazes, fight monsters and solve puzzles in order to escape with the prize. 
Fortunately, the sword that you now wield is a grand weapon indeed, and seems
to have some unusual magical abilities, that might aid you in your escape.

== General description ==

The view is top down, and the player proceeds through a series of maze-like
rooms. At first the player does not see the layout of the room, but it gets
revealed to him as he proceeds. However, he does not see points of interest,
loot or enemies unless he has line of sight to them. The player has 3 stats:
hp, mana and stamina, and 3 characteristics: strength, agility and intelligence.
The loot that the hero may pick up, include: health potion, mana potion,
key (of different types), stat upgrade crystal, char upgrade crystal. The 
player may encounter enemies, and then the game switches to a turn based battle
mode, where the player may choose between different types of attack moves,
defensive moves, potions or spells, granted to him by the sword. Different moves
scale from different characteristics. At the end of each room the hero can
unlock one additional move. The enemies can also attack and defend, and use 
spells and special moves. There are also 4 status effects: bleed, poison, stun
and fatigue, which can persist for some time after a battle.
There are also non-battle encounters with creatures and puzzles of the capital,
which play out in the shape of dialogues.

The goal of the game is to traverse a certain number of rooms, and leave the
city alive.

== Map ==
The map of a room is a 20x20 ascii square with lines as borders, one entry and
one exit.
